I made up my mind. After this mess, I'm leaving.

#name Player
Leaving? But weren't you fired?

#name Jules
Yeah, but I'm leaving on my own will. I'm not going to let a dead person dictate my life.

#name Player
So what are you going to do?

#name Jules
I'm going to fix my lef and be an acrobat again.
#name Jules
I heard Jake is this medicine genuius. Maybe I'll ask him for help with my leg.

#name Player
I wouldn't do that.

#name Jules
Why-

#name Player
Just... Don't.

-> END
