+ [What do you mean?]
    Jake` We're all just sitting around, just waiting to figure out what's going on. None of us know what to do.
+   + [Yeah, it's hard to process, isn't it?]
        Jake` Not really. He's dead. I'm more than capable of understanding that, even if it's sad.

            Jake` The hardest thing to process is what to do next. All we can do is sit around and wait. But I have to wonder, what are we waiting for?
