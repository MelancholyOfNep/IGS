Honestly, right now I really just want to go home.

I don't think anyone should go home right now.

#name Jules
I know! I'm a clown, not an idiot.
#name Jules
I just want to be able to take a nap.

#name Player
Yeah, I don't blame you.

#name Jules
I mean, normally i'd already be gone. But now I have to sit around thinking about death and murder.

#name Player
I'm sorry that death makes the work day longer. You're justified in your frustation.

-> END
