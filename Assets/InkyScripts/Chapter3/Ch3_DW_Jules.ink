Jules` Honestly, right now I really just want to go home.
+ [I don't think anyone should go home right now.]
    Jules` I know! I'm a clown, not an idiot.
+   + [(continue)]
        I just want to be able to take a nap.
+   +   + [Yeah, I don't blame you.]
            Jules` I mean, normally i'd already be gone. But now I have to sit around thinking about death and murder.
+   +   +   + [I'm sorry that death makes the work day longer. You're justified in your frustation.] -> END
