I don't think I want to perform again.

#name Player
What? But you love performing!

#name Tim
I know. And I do love it, I really do! But now I'm not sure I'll be able to separate my performance from death.

#name Player
I see...

#name Tim
But don't worry. I'm not making any life-changing decisions just yet.
#name Tim
I need some space to think before I do.

#name Player
That's a good idea. Just don't let something sad get in the way of doing what you want to do.
