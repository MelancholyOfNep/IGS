Stolen!? You mean someone took it?

#name Player
That is what 'stolen' means. Do you know who did it?

#name Jules
I don't, but it wasn't me!
#name Jules
The only thing I've stolen here are some kids' balloons, but only if they're being annoying.
#name Jules
Well, I've also stolen some snacks from the vendors here, and maybe a few stuffed animals.
#name Jules
But I would never steal from a coworker. They have too much to deal with anyway.
