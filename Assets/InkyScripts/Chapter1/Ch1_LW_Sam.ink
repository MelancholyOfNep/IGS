I could really go for a nap right now.

Did you ever worry about your kid, riding that roller coater all day?

Not at all. She enjoys it, and it gives me a bit of a rest, too.

But I mean, she loves that roller coaster so much she would probably love to become a roller coaster herself.

I think I stopped being funny when I became a parent.
