Bethany` This is my last ride of the day!
+ [Aren't you dizzy after all that?]
    Bethany` A little.
+   + [You must be tired, you aren't yelling anymore.]
        Bethany` ...
+   +   + [Well, this sounds like a day well spent.]
            You` Make sure to thank your parent for today.
+   +   +   + [(continue)]
                Bethany` I will, I promise. Right after this last ride.
